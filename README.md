# Yotube

My first data project. I took a database of viral youtube videos 'JPVideostrim.csv' and I tried to see if there was any correlation between the columns 'ratings_disabled' and 'comment_count'. Basically seeing if whether or not ratings being disabled on a youtube video caused more or less comments.
